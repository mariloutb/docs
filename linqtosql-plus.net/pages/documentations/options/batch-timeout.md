# BatchTimeout

## Description

Gets or sets the maximum of time in seconds to wait for a batch before the command throws a timeout exception. 


```csharp
// Instance
context.BulkSaveChanges(options => options.BatchTimeout = 180);

// Global
EntityFrameworkManager.BulkOperationBuilder = builder => builder.BatchTimeout = 180;
```

## Purpose
Having access to change the `BatchTimeout` gives you the flexibility required when some operations are too slow to complete due to several reasons such as:
- Batch Size
- Column Size
- Latency
- Trigger
- Etc.
