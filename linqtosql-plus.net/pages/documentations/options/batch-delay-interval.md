context.BulkInsert(list, options => options.BatchDelayInterval = 100);

// Global
EntityFrameworkManager.BulkOperationBuilder = builder => builder.BatchDelayInterval = 100;
```

## Purpose

## FAQ

### Why should I not use this option with transaction?
You should not because if may often lead to lock and deadlock.

A transaction must be as short as possible and completed as soon as possible.
